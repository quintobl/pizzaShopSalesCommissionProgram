CLI application written in Java in Eclipse allowing for sales and employee commission to be calculated for a pizza shop for IT 161 (Java Programming 1) for Cincinnati State

Assignment – Annotations & JavaDoc Comments
Problem 1 – Create PizzaSales##.java (where## is your initials) that allows the user to get pizza sales totals.
Create an application to allow Northside Pizza to total up pizza sales for the day.  This program needs to accept a total number of pizza sales based on the number of
sales entered by the user. (10 points) 
Use an array to store each pizza sales amount. Print out the total sales for the day. (10 points)
You must use the ReadFloatFromUserMethod and ReadIntegerFromUser methods. (20 points)
Print out the highest sale for the day. Print out the lowest sale for the day. Print the average price for an order for the day. (10 points)
Northside Pizza gives 2% commission of total sales to all the employees working that day. Allow the user to enter the number of employees working for the day. Print the 
total each employee will receive as commission. (10 points)
You must include at least 3 methods in your program.  (10 points)
Be sure to include the JavaDoc comments above the class name and all method names. (10 points)

For example:
Enter the total number of sales for the day:
Enter ticket # amount: <<<this needs to loop for x# of times based on user input
Total sales for the day:
Highest sale for the day:
Lowest sale for the day:
Average sale amount for the day:
Total employee commission is: 
Per employee commission amount: 

Problem 2 – Create a JavaDoc over the project your created in Step 1. Be sure to include include JavaDoc comments, author, and version. Provide a print screen of your
JavaDoc. (10 points)
Problem 3 – Provide a print-screen of your test results in your homework submission. (10 points)

Example:

Donna from Northside Pizza sold 5 orders today. She has 2 people working today. She wants a program to allow her to enter each ticket sale and output the total sales,
highest ticket sale, lowest ticket sale, average ticket sale, and commission to pay to each employee working that day. She can have anywhere from 1 to 20 employees working
each day. Here is an example of the input and output for this problem.

Sales Ticket 11:30AM = $40.00 total
Sales Ticket 11:32AM = $10.00 total 
Sales Ticket 12:30PM = $100.00 total 
Sales Ticket  2:30PM = $200.00 total
Sales Ticket  3:30PM = $80.00 total

She manually calculates this today but needs a program to add this up and give her the numbers so she can operate her business more efficiently.

Total sales = $430.00 
Average sales = $86.00
Highest sale = $200.00
Lowest sale = $10.00
Commission for each employee = $4.30
